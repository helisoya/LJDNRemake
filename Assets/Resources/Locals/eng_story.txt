# ------------------- Intro -------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------

Intro_1 = The province of Vlatyr, peaceful constituent of the United Provinces of Kosky.
Intro_2 = It is so calm, you could think almost nothing ever happens here.
Intro_3 = However, deep in the mountains, a mystery is afoot.
Intro_4 = What was once the domain of a terrible dragon, is now unoccupied.
Intro_5 = Some people tried to claim it for themselves, but failed.
Intro_6 = Rumors say a man came, and defeated them all.
Intro_7 = No one really knew who he was, or what he looked like.
Intro_8 = But thanks to him, the late dragon's domain and its treasure remained untouched.
Intro_9 = However, things did not stop here.
Intro_10 = Rumors resurfaced. They told of a strange sect residing in the old fortress.
Intro_11 = Who were they ? What was their goal ? People could only speculate...
Intro_12 = They seemed to worship a dangerous god, Lord Elk.
Intro_13 = In the local faith, he is the god of chaos and destruction.
Intro_14 = He was said to have walked this land, bringing about chaos everywhere he went.
Intro_15 = One day, he was stopped by the God of Gods : The Great Caribou.
Intro_16 = He sealed the evil Elk into the void, preventing him from spreading chaos.
Intro_17 = At least, that's what the legend said...
Intro_18 = Across the ages, many people tried to summon Lord Elk back, with little success.
Intro_19 = This sect seemed one more attempt to resurrect a long-gone entity.
Intro_20 = The rumors died down. Who cared about a strange sect in the mountains anyway ?
Intro_21 = Until...
Intro_22 = ...The old fortress exploded with no warning.
Intro_23 = The province was thrown into confusion, as nobody claimed the attack.
Intro_24 = Some claimed the sect failed their summoning of Lord Elk.
Intro_25 = Some claimed that a vigilante came and put a stop to their operation.
Intro_26 = In the end, nobody really knew. It could have been either of those. Maybe even both.
Intro_27 = But this was only an interlude for a coming storm.
Intro_28 = A storm so fierce, it could swallow the entire continent. 
Intro_29 = And at the center of it, a single person.
Intro_30 = They will be able to put an end to this storm.
Intro_31 = They will be able to solve the mysteries plaguing the province.
Intro_32 = Their name ? [MC].
Intro_33 = They will soon be thrown back into the fray, struggling to make sense of it all.
Intro_34 = Enemies will come from everywhere, even from within.
Intro_35 = They may even never come back from this dangerous quest.
Intro_36 = ........
Intro_37 = ........
Intro_38 = Wh- Where am I ?
Intro_39 = I had a weird dream... What was that ?
Intro_40 = Wait... I'm back, aren't I ?
Intro_41 = This is Vlatyr, Harold summoned me again...
Intro_42 = I thought it was over now. Can't I catch a break ?
Intro_43 = ...... Actually, where am I ?
Intro_44 = This isn't Harold's house. This is a lake.
Intro_45 = Now how do I find his house ? I don't remember where it is.
Intro_46 = A moving shadow catches my attention.
Intro_47 = Who's there ?!
Intro_48 = .......
Intro_49 = It seems I was wro-
Intro_50 = Hey lad, do you know the difference between a human and an ash grouse ?
Intro_51 = ...Hu ...Humans can't fly ?
Intro_52 = What ? You don't know the difference ? Me too !
Intro_53 = So, that makes you an Ash grouse. And I love to hunt ash grouses !
Intro_54 = Wait, what ?
Intro_55 = Die, little grouse !
Intro_56 = The hunter aims his rifle at me. I start running away.

Intro_57 = ...... I think I managed to get away....
Intro_58 = Who was that freak anyway ?
Intro_59 = Wait... This is Harold's house, right ?
Intro_60 = Good. He has a lot of explaining to do...
Intro_61 = I approach the house and knock on the door.
Intro_62 = .....
Intro_63 = After a few minutes, the door opens.
Intro_64 = Who's here at this hour ?
Intro_65 = [MC] ?! Is that you ?
Intro_66 = Yes, it's me.
Intro_67 = Ah ! Am I glad to see you !
Intro_68 = I thought the summoning failed... I got worried, you see.
Intro_69 = Last time I failed one, well...
Intro_70 = ... Well, I'm here now.
Intro_71 = So what's the situation ? Why did you summon me back ?
Intro_72 = I thought we agreed that I would stay on my world.
Intro_73 = Yes, well... I'm sorry, really.
Intro_74 = It's just, I am in trouble. And I figured only you could help me !
Intro_75 = Alright, alright... Tell me what happened this time...
Intro_76 = But please, no more lies. I'm not risking my life for some keys again.
Intro_77 = Well, in that case. I have good news and bad news.
Intro_78 = But we'll discuss this inside. Come.
Intro_79 = I follow Harold inside his house.
Intro_80 = It barely changed. I wonder how long it has been.
Intro_81 = How l-
Intro_82 = It has been one year, [MC]. One long year.
Intro_83 = Everything went quiet after you defeated the dragon.
Intro_84 = We've had some minor problems around a week after you left.
Intro_85 = But I managed to handle them. It was easy.
Intro_86 = You ? Going on a quest by yourself ?
Intro_87 = Well... Let's just say I had help.
Intro_88 = Right... What about the good and the bad news you said you had ?
Intro_89 = Oh, of course. Well...
Intro_90 = The bad news is that someone stole my belongings again.
Intro_91 = And the good news ?
Intro_92 = Well, this time it's not my keys. It's a book !
Intro_93 = .......
Intro_94 = .......
Intro_95 = I said something funny again, didn't I ?
Intro_96 = Yes you did...
Intro_97 = Oh, but wait ! It's not just any book !
Intro_98 = It's my grimoire ! My summoning grimoire !
Intro_99 = Within its page lie the secrets to summoning people into our world.
Intro_100 = You do understand the gravity of the situation, right ?
Intro_101 = If it falls into the wrong hands, it could be used to summon dangerous beings in this world.
Intro_102 = Oh. I see. Quite the pickle indeed...
Intro_103 = And who stole your book ? Do they still have it ?
Intro_104 = Well... How should I say it ?
Intro_105 = Maybe you should see for yourself...
Intro_106 = Harold motions me towards his television.
Intro_107 = He turns it on and changes the channel to a... peculiar one...

Intro_108 = Have you ever dreamed of going to an amazing park ?
Intro_109 = Well, dream no more ! RickeyLand is for you !
Intro_110 = We have everything for the family here. Come see our main attractions !
Intro_111 = The haunted house ! Will you find the exit of this spooky exhibit ?
Intro_112 = The Waldo Quiz ! Answer my assistant's questions and win prizes !
Intro_113 = The horse race ! Will you beat my security guards at a race ?
Intro_114 = Shooting the salesman ! Have fun shooting this insolent who tried to sell me junk !
Intro_115 = HELP ME !
Intro_116 = SHUT UP !
Intro_117 = What great attractions ! Everybody loves them !
Intro_118 = But there's more !
Intro_119 = The first person to beat all 4 attractions will earn a prize !
Intro_120 = Look at this book I st- got from an old man. What a wonderful prize !
Intro_121 = I'll even give you my autograph, because I'm such a great CEO !
Intro_122 = So come to the park ! RickeyLand awaits you !
Intro_123 = Oh, and before I forget. 
Intro_124 = Please come to the souvenir shop ! It's so great in here ! We have all the colors you'll ever need !
Intro_125 = And if I don't see you there.... I'LL END Y-

Intro_126 = .......
Intro_127 = What did I just see ?
Intro_128 = It's RickeyLand. You went to the park last time, remember ?
Intro_129 = And well... The prize book he showed... It's my grimoire.
Intro_130 = So you want me to go and win it for you ?
Intro_131 = Please, [MC]. You are my only hope !
Intro_132 = Okay, okay. But what did you do to make him so angry ?
Intro_133 = Well... It's a long story.
Intro_134 = But all you need to know is that Rickey, the CEO of RickeyLand, went crazy.
Intro_135 = He didn't do well financially last year, so the park declined.
Intro_136 = About a week ago, he snapped and decided to "invite" everyone in the province to come to his park.
Intro_137 = No doubt in a desperate attempt to gain money.
Intro_138 = And the crown jewel in his scheme is the prize, my grimoire.
Intro_139 = It doesn't seem like he knows its secrets. For now, at least...
Intro_140 = So I'll have to win it before he figures out it's not just a plain old book.
Intro_141 = Yes. But you'll have to wait until morning to gain access to the park.
Intro_142 = Please, feel free to use my bedroom for the night.
Intro_143 = I owe you at least that.
Intro_144 = Thank you, Harold.
Intro_145 = And so I decided to rest for the night.
Intro_146 = When the morning came, I decided to start my quest.
Intro_147 = Well, at least it's warmer now that the sun is up...
Intro_148 = I should head to RickeyLand now. The sooner I get this done, the sooner I get home.
Intro_149 = You can interact with glowing blue objects. To move, interact with the bottom of the screen.

ChezHarold_Harold_LastTime_1 = You last came here a year ago.
ChezHarold_Harold_LastTime_2 = At the time, I needed you to get my car keys back.
ChezHarold_Harold_LastTime_3 = Such a foolish errand. I'm truly sorry about that.
ChezHarold_Harold_LastTime_4 = Not long after your departure, another incident happened.
ChezHarold_Harold_LastTime_5 = Some people tried to take control of the dragon's fortress, including Rickey.
ChezHarold_Harold_LastTime_6 = I knew I couldn't call you back, not so soon anyway...
ChezHarold_Harold_LastTime_7 = So I decided to handle things myself. And it worked !
ChezHarold_Harold_LastTime_8 = The province was safe for a year, until last week...
ChezHarold_Harold_LastTime_9 = The old fortress exploded without warning, and Rickey stole my grimoire.
ChezHarold_Harold_LastTime_10 = I knew I needed help for this one, so I summoned you back.

ChezHarold_Harold_Grimoire_1 = My grimoire is full of magical secrets.
ChezHarold_Harold_Grimoire_2 = With it, one could easily summon anything into this world.
ChezHarold_Harold_Grimoire_3 = So you can guess what a mad CEO with a lust for power could do with this grimoire.
ChezHarold_Harold_Grimoire_4 = He could summon horrors far beyond our imagination, and conquer the world.
ChezHarold_Harold_Grimoire_5 = It's a good thing I remembered the incantation to summon you, or else I would have been in trouble.


ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest0_1 = You need to enter RickeyLand, [MC].
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest0_2 = Beating the park's 4 main attractions is the only way to get my grimoire back.

ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest1_1 = You need an invite to enter the park ?
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest1_2 = Well... I didn't get one then. Rickey must really hate me.
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest1_3 = You'll have to improvise. Maybe someone can give you their invite.

ChezHarold_Harold_Default = [MC] ! Do you need help with anything ?

ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest6_1 = [MC] ! You did it !
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest6_2 = Yes... I got your grimoire back.
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest6_3 = Did you have any problems while retrieving it ?
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest6_4 = Uhm... Not really.
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest6_5 = That's good to hear !
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest6_6 = If Rickey understood his potential, we would have been in trouble.
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest6_7 = But I'm glad to hear you succeeded in saving my grimoire.
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest6_8 = I'm also glad you are alright, of course !
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest6_9 = Thanks.
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest6_10 = Well... I guess I'm about done here.
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest6_11 = I guess this is the part where you send me back to my world ?
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest6_12 = ............
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest6_13 = Eh Eh Eh !
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest6_14 = Uh ?

ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest6_21 = Harold punches me with his gun. I lose consciousness immediately.

Vlatyr_ShopQuest1_1 = Hey, you !
Vlatyr_ShopQuest1_2 = A familiar face greets me.
Vlatyr_ShopQuest1_3 = Oh, are you the knight of Runan ? I have a box for you.
Vlatyr_ShopQuest1_4 = I remember this man caused a ruckus at the park last year.
Vlatyr_ShopQuest1_5 = I wonder if this is why he didn't come to pick it up at the shop.
Vlatyr_ShopQuest1_6 = It's me alright. So you got the box, nice.
Vlatyr_ShopQuest1_7 = I give the box to the knight. He quickly inspects it.
Vlatyr_ShopQuest1_8 = Hmm... It seems everything is in order.
Vlatyr_ShopQuest1_9 = Good. I'll be off then. Send my regards to the tall guy.
Vlatyr_ShopQuest1_10 = The knight disappears in a nearby street. That was awkward.
Vlatyr_ShopQuest1_11 = I should report back to Waldo.

Vlatyr_GUARD_Normal = Oh, hi !

Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_1 = Oh, hey there !

Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_3 = Oh, yes. I remember you.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_4 = What was his name, GUARD or something ?
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_5 = He was protecting the dragon's fortress. I lied to him in order to enter.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_6 = I hope he doesn't hold a grudge since I killed the dragon.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_7 = It was a shame, really.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_8 = ... Yeah...
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_9 = You came to pay tribute to Lord Ember, and he got killed by that samurai guy.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_10 = What ? He thinks I'm innocent ? Nice !
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_11 = But oh well. I decided to go on a little adventure after that.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_12 = Actually, you could lend me a hand if you want.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_13 = I might. What do you have in mind ?
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_14 = Remember this politician I told you about ? The one that got killed ?
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_15 = I decided to investigate the cult he was after.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_16 = I traveled the continent, going as far as the faraway city state of Kalia.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_17 = In the end, I managed to trace back the cult in the late dragon's fortress.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_18 = I, well.. they I suppose, then decided to deal with the cult once and for all.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_19 = They ? 
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_20 = A friend I made back in Kalia.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_21 = But more importantly, you mean you...
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_22 = Caused the destruction of the fortress ? Yes.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_23 = The cultists were all regrouped for some sort of congress.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_24 = We snuck in, and detonated a bomb.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_25 = We managed to wipe them all out. Or so we thought...
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_26 = Some of them survived ?
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_27 = That's what I think.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_28 = A few days ago, one of their front companies suddenly relocated.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_29 = And dead bodies can't relocate, as far as I know.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_30 = So this is where you come in.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_31 = I have to keep watch on the fronts. But I also have another thing to check.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_32 = Since we apparently missed some cultists, I would like you to investigate the fortress.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_33 = If you notice anything out of the ordinary, tell me. Any clue could be vital here.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_34 = Alright. I have things of my own to do, but I'll see what I can do.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestStart_35 = Thanks ! I appreciate it.

Vlatyr_GUARD_AboutYou_1 = I'm GUARD. I was a simple bodyguard just a year ago.
Vlatyr_GUARD_AboutYou_2 = You know, protecting a politician, a dragon, ...
Vlatyr_GUARD_AboutYou_3 = But things changed after I failed my missions.
Vlatyr_GUARD_AboutYou_4 = I failed, and I was shunned for my incompetence.
Vlatyr_GUARD_AboutYou_5 = But no matter. I have another mission now. I must stop that cult.

Vlatyr_GUARD_AboutSect_1 = The cult I'm after specializes in summoning.
Vlatyr_GUARD_AboutSect_2 = They are behind a series of attacks and murders in the region.
Vlatyr_GUARD_AboutSect_3 = I discovered their goal : Pure chaos.
Vlatyr_GUARD_AboutSect_4 = Why you may ask ? They worship a local god of Chaos : Lord Elk.
Vlatyr_GUARD_AboutSect_5 = They seemed to want to summon it back into this world.
Vlatyr_GUARD_AboutSect_6 = But hey. Now that most of them are dead, we should be safe.

Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_1 = Oh, hey ! Did you get lucky ?
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_2 = Yes. I found out that at least one cultist managed to make it out.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_3 = Ah, that's what I was afraid of...
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_4 = Anything else ?
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_5 = I also found this strange necklace. I thought you might know what it is.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_6 = Let me see.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_7 = Hmm.......
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_8 = I see.... Curious....
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_9 = This seems to be a ritual necklace.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_10 = I heard it is used to prevent the summoning of an entity.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_11 = You just put it on, and nearby casters won't be able to summon anything.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_12 = Actually, you can keep it. I get the feeling you may need it someday.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_13 = And what about you ?
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_14 = Another front just started relocating. I'm going to take action.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_15 = I guess I'll be off now. It was nice seeing you again.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_16 = Likewise. It was surely interesting.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_17 = GUARD bows and exits the street.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_18 = What a strange person. But I guess he has his mission to fulfill.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_19 = I look at the necklace. What do I even do with this ?
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_20 = Maybe I can put it on so Harold doesn't summon me back a third time.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_21 = ... Wouldn't work... Anyway. I should get going.
Vlatyr_GUARD_QuestEnd_22 = I put the necklace on me for now.


# ---------------------------------------------------------
# -------------- Chez Marcel ------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------

ChezMarcel_Marcel_Default_1 = Hey, lad. Found any Ash Grouses ?

ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutYou_1 = I'm just a local hunter. Nothing more.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutYou_2 = I like to hunt grouses, and drink beers with my friends.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutYou_3 = Do you know ol' Harold ? I drink with him sometimes.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutYou_4 = Although, he doesn't hunt. He says he doesn't like guns. I wonder why...

ChezMarcel_Marcel_LastNight_1 = We met each other last night ?
ChezMarcel_Marcel_LastNight_2 = That's weird, I was chasing an Ash Grouse all night.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_LastNight_3 = It was running quite fast now that I think about it.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_LastNight_4 = It could even scream in English. What an unusual bird.

ChezMarcel_Marcel_MainQuest1_1 = RickeyLand ? What's that, a bird ?
ChezMarcel_Marcel_MainQuest1_2 = No, it's an amusement park a few minutes away.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_MainQuest1_3 = They sent you an invite about a week ago.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_MainQuest1_4 = ? ... Wait...
ChezMarcel_Marcel_MainQuest1_5 = The hunter searches in his pockets, he takes out a piece of paper.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_MainQuest1_6 = I remember now ! I received this a week ago, like you said.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_MainQuest1_7 = I thought it was a map depicting where Ash Grouses were nesting.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_MainQuest1_8 = But I couldn't figure out where I was on the map, so I gave up.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_MainQuest1_9 = May I borrow it from you ? I need it for something.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_MainQuest1_10 = Be my guest. I don't have any use for it anyway.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_MainQuest1_11 = Great. I can now enter RickeyLand.

RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest0_4 = My invite ?
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest0_5 = Yes, you should have received it in your mailbox.
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest0_6 = Well, unless you are called Harold. The CEO hates Harold.
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest0_7 = Oh... I see. I think I forgot it at home.
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest0_8 = I'll go fetch it, sir.
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest0_9 = Great... I need an invite to enter RickeyLand, and I suppose Harold didn't get one.
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest0_10 = I might have to explore, and see if anyone has an invite I can borrow.

RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest1_1 = Hey ! No invite, no entry !

RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest2_1 = Wait, hold on !
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest2_2 = The guard appears again, blocking me from entering.
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest2_3 = What's up with security here anyway ?
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest2_4 = I managed to find my invite, sir. Here you go.
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest2_5 = ...
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest2_6 = Alright, you're set. Welcome to RickeyLand.
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest2_7 = Thank you, sir.
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest2_8 = Finally.... Let's get in.
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest2_9 = I enter the park, I hope it won't take long.
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest2_10 = So this is it, RickeyLand. I must say, I didn't really pay attention to my surroundings last time.
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest2_11 = This park seems huge. I shouldn't get lost.
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest2_12 = A stand catches my eye. It's offering maps of the park.
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest2_13 = Perfect. With this, I'll be able to find my way around.
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest2_14 = My first order of business is to finish the 4 attractions of RickeyLand.
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest2_15 = After that, I'll have to get Harold's book before someone else grabs it, or before Rickey figures out its secrets.
RickeyLandEntrance_MainQuest2_16 = I can exit RickeyLand by interacting with the gate at the entrance.

Palace_AttractionsDone_NoStamp_11 = What a strange place.

Palace_MainQuest4_1 = I enter the palace. Time to find Rickey.
Palace_MainQuest4_2 = The place is huge. It is quite hard to find the CEO in there.
Palace_MainQuest4_3 = But I manage to find some sort of throne room. Rickey is right in front of me.

Palace_MainQuest4_12 = Harold's grimoire. I finally managed to get it...
Palace_MainQuest4_13 = Alright ! I'll give you my autograph while I'm at it.
Palace_MainQuest4_14 = Who shall I dedicate this book to ?
Palace_MainQuest4_15 = Oh ! Uhm... Harold, I guess ?
Palace_MainQuest4_16 = I don't want my name to be on Harold's book. It might curse me forever.
Palace_MainQuest4_17 = HAROLD ?!
Palace_MainQuest4_18 = W- What ?!
Palace_MainQuest4_19 = I HATE HAROLD ! HE HUMILIATED ME !
Palace_MainQuest4_20 = Oh....
Palace_MainQuest4_21 = I should have guessed... I messed up...
Palace_MainQuest4_22 = How dare you speak his name in front of me !
Palace_MainQuest4_23 = I see it now. Harold sent you to retrieve his book !
Palace_MainQuest4_24 = Well... I mean...
Palace_MainQuest4_25 = Ah Ah ! I'm going to enjoy this !
Palace_MainQuest4_26 = Wait, wait !
Palace_MainQuest4_27 = I will torture you. Then I'll send you back to Harold in pieces !
Palace_MainQuest4_28 = I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE !
Palace_MainQuest4_29 = He's insane !
Palace_MainQuest4_30 = I need to get out of here, fast !
Palace_MainQuest4_31 = Running away ? TOO LATE !
Palace_MainQuest4_32 = Rickey punches me so hard, I pass out immediately.
Palace_MainQuest4_33 = .........
Palace_MainQuest4_34 = I open my eyes. I'm strapped to some sort of torture device.
Palace_MainQuest4_35 = Awake, uh ? Good.
Palace_MainQuest4_36 = You see, there is still something I need to know about Harold.
Palace_MainQuest4_37 = Actually, there are a lot of things I need to know.
Palace_MainQuest4_38 = Who is Harold ?
Palace_MainQuest4_39 = Where does Harold live ?
Palace_MainQuest4_40 = How is he so strong ?
Palace_MainQuest4_41 = And most importantly, how did he age so rapidly ?
Palace_MainQuest4_42 = Last year, we fought. I was defeated by a malevolent acrobat.
Palace_MainQuest4_43 = Later, we fought again. But this time he was old.
Palace_MainQuest4_44 = I want to know his trick ! How did he do it ?!
Palace_MainQuest4_45 = I could use this information to enhance my robots.
Palace_MainQuest4_46 = What ? Your robots ?
Palace_MainQuest4_47 = Shut up ! You are to answer my questions, not ask useless things.
Palace_MainQuest4_48 = So tell me ! What are Harold's secrets ?
Palace_MainQuest4_49 = I have no idea what you are talking about !
Palace_MainQuest4_50 = Grr... I'll have to zap you a few times.
Palace_MainQuest4_51 = I'll be back ! Wait here patiently...
Palace_MainQuest4_52 = .........
Palace_MainQuest4_53 = Oh no... What do I do ?
Palace_MainQuest4_54 = I can't get out of this device. Is this the end ?
Palace_MainQuest4_55 = ... Ah ! There you are !
Palace_MainQuest4_56 = Waldo enters the room. Why is he here ?
Palace_MainQuest4_57 = Quick ! The CEO will be back soon. Let's go.
Palace_MainQuest4_58 = Why are you helping me ?
Palace_MainQuest4_59 = Later ! Right now we need to exit this place.
Palace_MainQuest4_60 = I follow Waldo outside. 
Palace_MainQuest4_61 = My entire body screams in agony. Rickey must have hit me quite hard...
Palace_MainQuest4_62 = Waldo guides me to the souvenir shop.
Palace_MainQuest4_63 = Right. We should be safe here. There are no guards and no cameras.
Palace_MainQuest4_64 = I guess I should explain a few things to you, right ?
Palace_MainQuest4_65 = Yeah... What was that all about ?
Palace_MainQuest4_66 = The CEO really hates a guy named Harold. I don't know why though.
Palace_MainQuest4_67 = The way he talks about him, he must be mistaken between two people.
Palace_MainQuest4_68 = But anyway, you must have mentioned Harold to him. Or maybe you are called Harold ?
Palace_MainQuest4_69 = No, no. I came here on behalf of an old man called Harold.
Palace_MainQuest4_70 = Ah... Harold. I haven't seen the old guy in a long time.
Palace_MainQuest4_71 = You know him ?
Palace_MainQuest4_72 = We used to be partners a few years back. He helped me when I was in trouble.
Palace_MainQuest4_73 = I see...
Palace_MainQuest4_74 = But what do I do now ? I need that prize book, and the park will surely be on the lookout for me.
Palace_MainQuest4_75 = Yes, well... I think I can help with that.
Palace_MainQuest4_76 = I have enough clearance to redirect the guards away from the palace.
Palace_MainQuest4_77 = That way, you'll be able to enter the palace without having to worry about them.
Palace_MainQuest4_78 = Why are you helping me, though ?
Palace_MainQuest4_79 = Well... The park's management leaves a lot to be desired.
Palace_MainQuest4_80 = Plus, I don't like the idea of torturing the only guest we had today.
Palace_MainQuest4_81 = So I'm really just trying to save the image of the park. What's left of it anyway...
Palace_MainQuest4_82 = I see... Well, thanks for the help.
Palace_MainQuest4_83 = If you need anything else, I'll be right here.

Palace_MainQuest5_1 = Alright, time to try again.
Palace_MainQuest5_2 = Waldo didn't lie. There are no guards around here.
Palace_MainQuest5_3 = I just need to find Rickey now and steal the grimoire back.
Palace_MainQuest5_4 = At least, I hope I won't get knocked out in one hit like last time...
Palace_MainQuest5_5 = I enter the palace again.
Palace_MainQuest5_6 = This time, I go straight to the throne room.
Palace_MainQuest5_7 = Sure enough, Rickey is there.
Palace_MainQuest5_8 = He seems a bit... off ?
Palace_MainQuest5_9 = Hey ! It's time to settle things once and for all !
Palace_MainQuest5_10 = ........
Palace_MainQuest5_11 = Uh... Did you hear me ?
Palace_MainQuest5_12 = !

Palace_MainQuest5_28 = Dedic- Baak ! Where Name ?
Palace_MainQuest5_29 = AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH !
Palace_MainQuest5_30 = What am I supposed to do ?
Palace_MainQuest5_31 = Is this Rickey's robot ? What is this thing even supposed to do ?
Palace_MainQuest5_32 = You can autograph it to [MC], I suppose ?
Palace_MainQuest5_33 = Checking DATABASE...
Palace_MainQuest5_34 = [MC] to Harold Ration : 67%.
Palace_MainQuest5_35 = Threshold activated. Beginning destroction.
Palace_MainQuest5_36 = It's trying to kill me again... Will it break down a second time ?

Palace_MainQuest5_42 = WELCOME TO- -COME RI- WAL- HELLO !
Palace_MainQuest5_43 = ...........
Palace_MainQuest5_44 = What the hell was that ?
Palace_MainQuest5_45 = The robot just had a meltdown. I guess I won ?
Palace_MainQuest5_46 = How dare you destroy my perfect CEO Robot !
Palace_MainQuest5_47 = I look up, Rickey is at the balcony.
Palace_MainQuest5_48 = Grr ! I knew you would get out ! I understand everything now !
Palace_MainQuest5_49 = You ARE Harold ! You are actually a master spy !
Palace_MainQuest5_50 = You have the ability to change your appearance. This is your trick !
Palace_MainQuest5_51 = What ? No !
Palace_MainQuest5_52 = SHUT UP !
Palace_MainQuest5_53 = Now that you saw my Rick0 prototype, I'll have to kill you.
Palace_MainQuest5_54 = It killed itself !
Palace_MainQuest5_55 = Maybe ! But you pushed it too far, you bully !
Palace_MainQuest5_56 = My CEO robots are fragile creatures. They cannot function properly yet.
Palace_MainQuest5_57 = A minor setback, you see. I just need to find a way to give them a proper AI system.
Palace_MainQuest5_58 = So they don't work at all then...
Palace_MainQuest5_59 = But why do you even have them ?
Palace_MainQuest5_60 = Insolent ! Always asking questions...
Palace_MainQuest5_61 = But I suppose I could answer that one. Your last question, after all...
Palace_MainQuest5_62 = My goal is simple : create an army of cyber-CEOs to take over the world !
Palace_MainQuest5_63 = Imagine ! They would travel the continent and create new RickeyLands !
Palace_MainQuest5_64 = People from all over the world will then come to our parks. And I'll be rich !
Palace_MainQuest5_65 = Sounds terribly complicated. Couldn't you pay som-
Palace_MainQuest5_66 = No ! You don't understand ! I'm the only one with the vision !
Palace_MainQuest5_67 = Only I can make RickeyLand prosper ! Only me !
Palace_MainQuest5_68 = I mean... I think the current state of the park speaks for itself...
Palace_MainQuest5_69 = But anyway, enough questions ! Time for you to die !
Palace_MainQuest5_70 = But how do I kill you ? Bullets are too soft a death...
Palace_MainQuest5_71 = I know ! I'll sing a rap so great it will kill you !
Palace_MainQuest5_72 = Uh ?
Palace_MainQuest5_73 = I don't even have time to process this. Rickey is already starting to sing.

Palace_MainQuest5_74 = RHA ! STOP RUINING MY RAP !
Palace_MainQuest5_75 = I'll break you ! I'll kill you, Harold !
Palace_MainQuest5_76 = I'l-
Palace_MainQuest5_77 = AH ! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !
Palace_MainQuest5_78 = Wha-
Palace_MainQuest5_79 = Rickey tripped over the balcony and fell down head first into the ground.
Palace_MainQuest5_80 = ..... Uhm....
Palace_MainQuest5_81 = He's... dead ?
Palace_MainQuest5_82 = Oh....... Oops ?
Palace_MainQuest5_83 = I... I guess that means I can take the grimoire back ?
Palace_MainQuest5_84 = I search Rickey's body. And sure enough, I find the grimoire.
Palace_MainQuest5_85 = It feels wrong to do this though...
Palace_MainQuest5_86 = What do I do now ? I might end up in prison for this.
Palace_MainQuest5_87 = What's going on here ?
Palace_MainQuest5_88 = Waldo ! I.. I mean... the CEO...
Palace_MainQuest5_89 = Oh... Oh no.
Palace_MainQuest5_90 = Well... I guess I'll have to take over RickeyLand for now then.
Palace_MainQuest5_91 = I suppose it was an accident ? Doesn't surprise me, honestly.
Palace_MainQuest5_92 = .. He believes me...
Palace_MainQuest5_93 = Did you get what you wanted ?
Palace_MainQuest5_94 = Yes. I got the book Harold wanted.
Palace_MainQuest5_95 = Good. Now you should go back and give it to him.
Palace_MainQuest5_96 = I'm sure he's waiting for you.
Palace_MainQuest5_97 = Yeah. I'm sorry for the mess I caused...
Palace_MainQuest5_98 = Meh, don't sweat it. I was kind of prepared for that.
Palace_MainQuest5_99 = Rickey was always arrogant. It was only a matter of time before it came back to bite him.
Palace_MainQuest5_100 = Sadly, I'll have to ask you to leave. I'm closing the park for now.
Palace_MainQuest5_101 = I need to clean up this mess. And recreate an image for the park.
Palace_MainQuest5_102 = Maybe I'll even change the name ? I'll see.
Palace_MainQuest5_103 = Alright, I'll be off then. It was nice to meet you.
Palace_MainQuest5_104 = Likewise.
Palace_MainQuest5_105 = I say goodbye, then exit the palace.
Palace_MainQuest5_106 = Once outside, I exit the park.
Palace_MainQuest5_107 = It's finally over...
Palace_MainQuest5_108 = I just need to give the book back to Harold, and then he'll bring me back home.
Palace_MainQuest5_109 = Let's go !

Fortress_GUARDQuest0_5 = I can't go through the front door, so I enter via a window.
Fortress_GUARDQuest0_6 = The fortress was completely destroyed. The floor is tilted now.
Fortress_GUARDQuest0_7 = No matter, I need to check this place for clues.
Fortress_GUARDQuest0_8 = But where should I look ? This place is big...

Fortress_GUARDQuest0_18 = Uh ?
Fortress_GUARDQuest0_19 = I find a strange necklace on the ground.
Fortress_GUARDQuest0_20 = Maybe it was a cultist's.
Fortress_GUARDQuest0_21 = I should take it to GUARD. Maybe he can tell me what it is.
Fortress_GUARDQuest0_22 = I also find a trail of what looks like blood.
Fortress_GUARDQuest0_23 = It seems at least a week old. It could indicate that a cultist fled the scene.
Fortress_GUARDQuest0_24 = I decide to follow the trail. It may lead to more clues.
Fortress_GUARDQuest0_25 = I follow the trail back to the entrance of the fortress.
Fortress_GUARDQuest0_26 = This person managed to exit the fortress by jumping off the balcony.
Fortress_GUARDQuest0_27 = I take a safer path. I can't get injured here.
Fortress_GUARDQuest0_28 = I follow the trail back to the bridge, but it stops suddenly.
Fortress_GUARDQuest0_29 = ... Maybe the person treated his injury ?
Fortress_GUARDQuest0_30 = Well, I can't continue to tail them. I should report back to GUARD.
Fortress_GUARDQuest0_31 = He should be happy enough with the necklace I found.

End_Part1_1 = .............
End_Part1_2 = I open my eyes. Where am I ?
End_Part1_3 = This is definitely not Harold's house.
End_Part1_4 = Speaking of which... He betrayed me...
End_Part1_5 = But why ? Is he plotting to force me to work for him forever ?
End_Part1_6 = I mean. He already broke his word once... And he lied to me in the past, so...
End_Part1_7 = ...
End_Part1_8 = I can hear someone coming this way.
End_Part1_9 = Oh ! You woke up, [MC].
End_Part1_10 = Harold ! But why ?
End_Part1_11 = Eh Eh Eh ! You wouldn't understand.
End_Part1_12 = You just gave me the final piece to complete my grand plan.
End_Part1_13 = What grand plan ? What piece ?
End_Part1_14 = Eh Eh Eh ! Do you have any idea of the power contained in the grimoire ?
End_Part1_15 = ........
End_Part1_16 = Eh ! Finally catching on, uh ?
End_Part1_17 = Our cult of the Summoners is in a dire state, you see.
End_Part1_18 = That stupid Kalian and his weird sidekick defeated us at the fortress.
End_Part1_19 = They even blew it up ! My entire cult, gone in a day !
End_Part1_20 = Do you even know how much time it took me to built it ?
End_Part1_21 = A shadow empire, stretching as far as the distant ports of Kalia.
End_Part1_22 = All in the name of our lord. The Great Lord Elk.
End_Part1_23 = Anyway. When the fortress was destroyed, I lost all my summoning materials.
End_Part1_24 = I even lost that other kid I manipulated after you left.
End_Part1_25 = I had nothing left, but a few of my henchmen. Not enough for our master's grand plan !
End_Part1_26 = For this purpose, I decided to launch a new operation : retrieving the grimoire Rickey stole from me.
End_Part1_27 = It is the only remaining book describing the ancient arts of summoning.
End_Part1_28 = With it, I can summon new pawns to build a new empire !
End_Part1_29 = And when we're ready, I'll summon back Lord Elk into this world.
End_Part1_30 = He will destroy this world, and the cult will reign supreme.
End_Part1_31 = This is insane !
End_Part1_32 = Eh Eh Eh ! And you just helped me kick-start it all !
End_Part1_33 = You were naive enough to help me, so it was a piece of cake.
End_Part1_34 = Yes, you might not be as idiotic as the other kid. But with enough time, I'll reshape you into the perfect cultist.
End_Part1_35 = I won't stand for this.
End_Part1_36 = Eh ! You won't have a choice, [MC].
End_Part1_37 = Well, I need to go now. I have an empire to rebuild.
End_Part1_38 = ............
End_Part1_39 = Harold was the leader of a cult ? Since the beginning ?
End_Part1_40 = I guess slaying the dragon was some sort of test then.
End_Part1_41 = He wanted to know if he could make a good pawn of me. 
End_Part1_42 = But I won't stand for this !
End_Part1_43 = I'll break out, I'll defeat Harold !
End_Part1_44 = Doesn't matter if I never see my home world again. I could die here.
End_Part1_45 = And I can't just run away. Harold is too powerful to be left alone.
End_Part1_46 = ..... But how do I get out ?
End_Part1_47 = I examine the cell's door. Maybe there is a way for me to open it from the inside.
End_Part1_48 = ......
End_Part1_49 = The... The door is unlocked ?
End_Part1_50 = I mean... I guess Harold is still Harold. Even if he's evil, he's still quite stupid.
End_Part1_51 = Alright, time to find our old friend and teach him a lesson.
End_Part1_52 = I roam around this weird place in search of Harold.
End_Part1_53 = This place is huge. It seems to be some sort of fortress, not unlike the dragon's fortress.
End_Part1_54 = Now that I think about it. Am I even still in Vlatyr ?
End_Part1_55 = We could be anywhere, from Harold's secret basement to a fortress in the skies.
End_Part1_56 = .....
End_Part1_57 = After walking for a few minutes. I can hear a faint voice coming from a nearby room.
End_Part1_58 = But who do I summon first ?
End_Part1_59 = Felix ? No... I still need to find a chef capable of cooking burgers before that.
End_Part1_60 = Axel ? Hmm.... Maybe ? ..... On second thought, maybe not.
End_Part1_61 = Harold seems to be trying to find the perfect pawn, or so it seems.
End_Part1_62 = Time to crash his party.
End_Part1_63 = I enter the room, Harold is looking at the window, muttering nonsense.
End_Part1_64 = But what about Juno ? .... No, the landscape change would be too brutal for them.
End_Part1_65 = Harold !
End_Part1_66 = Uh ?! What the ! How ?!
End_Part1_67 = How did you get out from your cell ?!
End_Part1_68 = It was left unlocked...
End_Part1_69 = Oh...
End_Part1_70 = I mean, usually, I have henchmen to do this for me, so...
End_Part1_71 = Anyway ! It doesn't matter ! You can't defeat me !
End_Part1_72 = Oh please, you're just an old guy.
End_Part1_73 = I slayed a dragon, remember ?
End_Part1_74 = Eh Eh Eh ! You fool !
End_Part1_75 = I am not any old man, [MC] !
End_Part1_76 = Didn't Waldo tell you about our time together ?
End_Part1_77 = Uh ?
End_Part1_78 = Not too long ago, I was in Runan defeating powerful enemy after powerful enemy.
End_Part1_79 = The Knight of Runan, that clown, the damn chef ! I defeated them all !
End_Part1_80 = I could have defeated the dragon anytime. But I chose not to.
End_Part1_81 = I chose instead to test you. To see if you had what it takes to be my pawn.
End_Part1_82 = You passed, but you are still an apprentice to me.
End_Part1_83 = Right ! I'd like to see you fight !
End_Part1_84 = You lied to me a lot in the past. This could be another one of your tricks.
End_Part1_85 = Eh Eh Eh ! Fine !
End_Part1_86 = GET READY !
End_Part1_87 = FOR !
End_Part1_88 = THE !
End_Part1_89 = GREATEST DANCER IN THE WORLD !
End_Part1_90 = What th-
End_Part1_91 = Eh Eh Eh ! You never knew it, but I always have my combat clothes underneath my civilian clothes !
End_Part1_92 = I'll wipe the floor with you, you'll see !
End_Part1_93 = And then you'll understand who the true master is.
End_Part1_94 = Harold prepares himself. It's the final showdown.

End_Part2_1 = What ?!
End_Part2_2 = How could I have been defeated at dance ?!
End_Part2_3 = You underestimated me.
End_Part2_4 = Never ! I'm the best ! I know it !
End_Part2_5 = I would never lose against a kid.
End_Part2_6 = There's only one answer to that... You cheated !
End_Part2_7 = You had help, didn't you ? Someone helped you dance !
End_Part2_8 = No, you just suck.
End_Part2_9 = Rha ! Time for you to die, [MC] !
End_Part2_10 = Harold jumps at me. But this time, I'm ready.
End_Part2_11 = I easily dodge Harold's attack.
End_Part2_12 = Then, I shove him to the ground.
End_Part2_13 = Ah !
End_Part2_14 = Damn you, [MC]...
End_Part2_15 = Taking advantage of my elderly body like that...
End_Part2_16 = You won't get me with the same trick twice.
End_Part2_17 = Grr....
End_Part2_18 = So it has come to this...
End_Part2_19 = Fine ! You defeated me...
End_Part2_20 = Uh ? It was this easy ?
End_Part2_21 = You are my superior. I see it now...
End_Part2_22 = I relax a bit. It's finally over.
End_Part2_23 = Okay, if you say so. But now, you need to stop this insanity.
End_Part2_24 = Alright, alright...
End_Part2_25 = I swear. I won't do any cult stuff anymore.
End_Part2_26 = I'll only do Harold things ! Like drinking coffee.
End_Part2_27 = And you'll send me back to my world.
End_Part2_28 = Grr.... Fine ! I guess I don't have a choice...
End_Part2_29 = I'll send you back. I'll dismantle the cult. You won, [MC].
End_Part2_30 = ... Are you happy ?
End_Part2_31 = You ruined my entire life in a single day.
End_Part2_32 = .....
End_Part2_33 = The silence treatment, eh ?
End_Part2_34 = Fine... I get it... I lost.
End_Part2_35 = Summoning you was my undoing. I should have been more careful...
End_Part2_36 = ....
End_Part2_37 = Can... Can you help me back up ?
End_Part2_38 = I'm old... I can't do it myself.
End_Part2_39 = And besides, I can't send you back like that. I need to create a potion for you.
End_Part2_40 = Fine.
End_Part2_41 = I extend my hand to Harold, to help him back up.
End_Part2_42 = ... Eh ! You fool !
End_Part2_43 = Uh ?!
End_Part2_44 = Harold jolts back up and sends me flying.
End_Part2_45 = I was tricked ! He's not just some old guy after all.
End_Part2_46 = Surprise attack, [MC] !
End_Part2_47 = Eh Eh Eh ! You really thought I couldn't get up myself ?
End_Part2_48 = Seriously, dismantling the cult ? What a joke !
End_Part2_49 = Even I cannot dismantle it. The cult is eternal !
End_Part2_50 = After my death, my master will choose a new cult leader.
End_Part2_51 = They will restore the cult to its former glory in due time.
End_Part2_52 = So you see, you cannot defeat us.
End_Part2_53 = You may defeat me, but you may never defeat the cult. Never !
End_Part2_54 = I'll still try !
End_Part2_55 = Eh ! You are so sure you can defeat us. Maybe you think you can even defeat my master ?
End_Part2_56 = If I can defeat you, why wouldn't I be able to defeat them ?
End_Part2_57 = So you think you can defeat our master, Lord Elk. God of Chaos.
End_Part2_58 = Amusing, to say the least.
End_Part2_59 = This gives me an idea. A way to finally get rid of you.
End_Part2_60 = I understand I cannot defeat you. We are evenly matched.
End_Part2_61 = But my master can and will kill you.
End_Part2_62 = So I'll just summon him !
End_Part2_63 = Eh Eh Eh ! Are you ready to die, [MC] ?
End_Part2_64 = You can't be serious...
End_Part2_65 = Eh Eh Eh ! Summoning my master will probably kill me, but if I can get rid of you that way...
End_Part2_66 = You are ready to die just to kill me ?
End_Part2_67 = Our plans are more important than my life, [MC].
End_Part2_68 = We cannot stop. We must plunge the world into chaos.
End_Part2_69 = Very well. Let us begin the ritual !
End_Part2_70 = No !
End_Part2_71 = Eh Eh Eh !
End_Part2_72 = My master, Lord Elk ! Hear me !
End_Part2_73 = I summon you ! I summon you to destroy our enemies !
End_Part2_74 = Use my body ! Use my soul ! Come back to this world !

End_Part2_Elk_1 = Eh Eh Eh ! Ah Ah Ah !
End_Part2_Elk_2 = Eh... Eh... Eh...
End_Part2_Elk_3 = The room is filled with a thick, black fog.
End_Part2_Elk_4 = I can't even hear Harold's laughter anymore.
End_Part2_Elk_5 = What is going on ?!
End_Part2_Elk_6 = The fog dissipates a little, but...
End_Part2_Elk_7 = Uh ?
End_Part2_Elk_8 = An... elk ?
End_Part2_Elk_9 = Is this the evil Elk Harold talked about ?
End_Part2_Elk_10 = It doesn't look very evil.
End_Part2_Elk_11 = .........
End_Part2_Elk_12 = Foolish mortal.
End_Part2_Elk_13 = Uh ?! The Elk stood up ?!
End_Part2_Elk_14 = You think you can defeat me, Lord Elk ?   
End_Part2_Elk_15 = Well, uhm...
End_Part2_Elk_16 = I must say, I am disappointed in Harold.
End_Part2_Elk_17 = That fool should have been able to kill you.
End_Part2_Elk_18 = And now, I'll have to find a new pawn for my grand plan.
End_Part2_Elk_19 = I suppose I could brainwash you to do my bidding.
End_Part2_Elk_20 = But after seeing your struggles. I think it isn't wise.
End_Part2_Elk_21 = So I'll simply kill you.
End_Part2_Elk_22 = Wait, wait... You aren't real, right ?
End_Part2_Elk_23 = This is just another of Harold's tricks, right ?   
End_Part2_Elk_24 = Harold is dead. And you'll join him soon.
End_Part2_Elk_25 = Any last words, mortal ?
End_Part2_Elk_26 = Uh ? Uhmm... I...
End_Part2_Elk_27 = As you wish. Now get ready to die.
End_Part2_Elk_28 = No !
End_Part2_Elk_29 = The fog thickens once more.
End_Part2_Elk_30 = It gets harder to breathe by the second.
End_Part2_Elk_31 = Is this... how... it... ends... ?
End_Part2_Elk_32 = ...........
End_Part2_Elk_33 = ...........
End_Part2_Elk_34 = Foolish Human.
End_Part2_Elk_35 = Things could have gone differently had you ventured into the fortress.
End_Part2_Elk_36 = But you did not. And now you are doomed.
End_Part2_Elk_37 = ...........
End_Part2_Elk_38 = THE END.
End_Part2_Elk_39 = (Bad ending)
End_Part2_Elk_40 = Thank you for playing Harold's Quest - RickeyLand ! 

End_Part2_Good_1 = Eh Eh Eh ! Ah Ah... Ah ?
End_Part2_Good_2 = Uh ? Why isn't this working ?
End_Part2_Good_3 = My master should have been summoned ! You should be dead !
End_Part2_Good_4 = .... Is it because of the necklace I found in the fortress ?
End_Part2_Good_5 = I... Wait... No...
End_Part2_Good_6 = You have the necklace ! Damn it !
End_Part2_Good_7 = I can't summon anything if it's near me !
End_Part2_Good_8 = Grr.... Now what do I do ?
End_Part2_Good_9 = I guess I'll just have to retreat, for now.
End_Part2_Good_10 = Harold approaches the window.
End_Part2_Good_11 = Consider this your victory for now, [MC] !
End_Part2_Good_12 = But remember this ! This isn't over !
End_Part2_Good_13 = I'll gather my strength ! I'll destroy you !
End_Part2_Good_14 = You cannot win against the Summoners cult ! You cannot !
End_Part2_Good_15 = Harold opens the window. Is he trying to jump ?!
End_Part2_Good_16 = What are you- ?
End_Part2_Good_17 = Eh Eh Eh ! A fall like that won't kill me, [MC] !
End_Part2_Good_18 = Don't forget that I'm the true master here !
End_Part2_Good_19 = Live in fear, for I am only a shadow away from you.
End_Part2_Good_20 = I'll be back soon enough. I'll be strong enough to kill you ten times !
End_Part2_Good_21 = With that being said. Goodbye !
End_Part2_Good_22 = Harold jumps out of the window. I race to it.
End_Part2_Good_23 = Looking outside, I can't see Harold. Where did he go ?
End_Part2_Good_24 = Did he just teleport ? Or maybe he actually scaled the wall ?
End_Part2_Good_25 = Well... it doesn't matter anymore.
End_Part2_Good_26 = Like Harold said, I won. For now at least.
End_Part2_Good_27 = He'll strengthen himself in the shadows. He'll be back someday.
End_Part2_Good_28 = I need to do the same. I need to get ready for our next encounter.
End_Part2_Good_29 = When will it be ? I don't know.
End_Part2_Good_30 = But I need to train, I must be ready.
End_Part2_Good_31 = .... Now that I think about it.
End_Part2_Good_32 = Where will I live ? I'm stuck in this world now.
End_Part2_Good_33 = .... I guess I'll find out on the way.
End_Part2_Good_34 = Maybe I can ask Waldo for help ? He seemed friendly enough.
End_Part2_Good_35 = Then again. Maybe I'll travel the world, to see what this strange world has to offer.
End_Part2_Good_36 = Until Harold's return... Let's do it !
End_Part2_Good_37 = .........
End_Part2_Good_38 = THE END.
End_Part2_Good_39 = (Good ending)
End_Part2_Good_40 = Thank you for playing Harold's Quest - RickeyLand !
